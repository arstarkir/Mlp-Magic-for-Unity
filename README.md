# Mlp-Magic-for-Unity
I created a script for Unity that gives you an ability levitate objects using mlp like magic.
For this project I used "mlp-magic" made by RoBorg Link: https://github.com/RoBorg/mlp-magic
And in the damo I used Standard Assets from Unity but I think I will delete them later.

I made this script for myself to use in any mlp projects where I might need it 
but then I decided that their is no time better then now to start adding staff to my github.
So I created this reposetory)

How this staff works:
at the start you need to add MaskCamera as a child of your main camera
then add CameraEffect to your main camera and grab your MaskCamera in Mask Camera fild
then you need to add Magic script to your player
thats it

If you whant the player to be able to lift an object simply add tag "Levitatable".

Controls Q for magic, Mouse wheel for a change in the distanse to controled object.
